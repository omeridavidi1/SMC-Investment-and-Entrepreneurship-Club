                <h1>Financial Analysis</h1>
                <p>
                    Every public company has to release their financial description, in order to inform investors how the comapany operates. 
                    Financial operations are stated on what's known as a 10k (Yearly) or 10q (Quarterly). Investors should analyze a comapny's 
                    operations not by just looking at the numbers, but understanding the story behind them.
                    <br><br>
                    You may do research on any public company, which is filed under the Security Exchange Commision (www.sec.gov), by utilizing 
                    the EDGAR database to search for the compnay's financial statments. We have chosen Home Depot as a company and included the 
                    fundamental analysis.

                                        the compnay performed over the course of 5 years in the "Five Year Summary of Financial

                                        As you can see, Net Earnings has increased over time and net store openings were 22 
                                        units, during the four years.

                                        <em>IS THIS A HIGH GROWTH BUSINESS? IS IT PROFITABLE?</em>
                                        <br><br>
                                        This is not a high growth business.  It is a mature business and growth is primarily a function 
                                        of population growth, housing development, and sales of home supplies. Notice the company has not 
                                        opened many stores during the past four years, yet the company is still profitable because profits 
                                        have been growing faster than revenues. 
                                        <br>
                                        Keep in mind, THE HOME DEPOT INC. is a compnay that only focuses on supplies for home development. 
                                        This company is not like FACEBOOK or APPLE where technology constantly advances and competitors have more 
                                        opportunities to be more profitable.  It is hard to know if THE HOME DEPOT INC. is "solidly profitable" 
                                        unless we compare it to competitors and other businesses in the same category.

                                        Let's take a look at the trend in certain areas. Home Depot's debt has increased by $8.9Bil, or 60%.
                                        Treasury stock increased by $21Bil, or 109%.   Total assets has not changed much, reflecting the 
                                        fact that they have not opened many stores.  There is an increase in inventory, to support increase 
                                        in sales.  Dramatic decrease in stockholdersâ€™ equity, since cumulative dividends and share purchases 
                                        ($29.8Bil) have exceeded cumulative earnings ($21.3Bil).

                                        financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for

                                        There was a 6.2% increase in comparable store sales during fiscal 
                                        year 2016. According to Investopedia, comparable store sales refers 
                                        to the amount of revenue a retail location generated in the most recent 
                                        accounting period relative to the amount of revenue it generated at the 
                                        same time the past.So for example you would compare the first week of 2017 
                                        with the first week of 2016 or a specific date of this year and the same one last year.

                                        There is a progressive trend in operating income.  It is occuring because of 
                                        selling; general and administrative expenses are decreasing year over year.

                                        At the bottom (2), for "Selected Sales Data," these metrics would exclude 
                                        results for Interline which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. 
                                        There is an increase year over year. The growth in fiscal 2015 was greater than fiscal 
                                        2016.

                                        It reflected the income that was generated without Interline.It did not affect the 
                                        operating income as a percentage of sales. The operating income was affected by a 
                                        reduction in selling, general and administrative expense and not by an increment of sales.
