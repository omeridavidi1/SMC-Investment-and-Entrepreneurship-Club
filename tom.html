                                Growing up I witnessed my brother's medical struggles and it inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, 
                                specifically, to become an emergency room doctor - to be "the guy" people relied on in a crisis. My first 
                                semester's grades in college suggested I revisit that calling and I did - I became a turnaround guy.
	    						<br><br>
                                Since my first real job I have been able to visualize what needs to be done in distressed and 
                                under-performing situations, sell the vision to stakeholders and work with people to make things 
                                better. During my 24-year career as a turnaround consultant and crisis manager I have led the 
                                turnarounds of the country's largest dairy, a fine linens retailer, an Xbox manufacturer, the maker 
                                of AstroTurf and the restaurant at Barneys New York.

                                Just as in my work, I like to roll-up my sleeves and put my hands in the dirt. My parents were 
                                gardeners and scratch cooks, my mom a farm-girl, my dad an enthusiastic first-generation Italian. 
                                I am grateful and blessed to have both of those genes.
								<br><br>
                                My education - read professors - changed my life and I am the biggest cheerleader for our university 
                                system. I have made it a point to help anyone who shows the work ethic and dream to improve their 
                                education. I recently added a certificate in Global Sustainability to mine.
