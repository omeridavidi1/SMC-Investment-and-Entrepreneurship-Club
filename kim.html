                                Understanding that Santa Monica College resembles an educational hub with an influx of geographically 
                                and culturally diverse students every semester, we hope to capitalise on this undervalued resource in our 
                                school. My goal for the club is to propel ourselves as a platform for students to exchange ideas and 
                                establish long term professional relationships with one another. Positioning ourselves as a business 
                                forum will allow students to freely express their ideas and learn from each other. Together with other 
                                business clubs in Santa Monica College, my vision for the club and the school is for us to establish a 
                                business community and for us to play a dynamic role on campus to provide a greater variety of 
                                entrepreneurial resource to students.
                                <br><br>
                                I believe that the business community should not be branded as an exclusive resource available to business 
                                majors. It should be understood that it is accessible to students of all majors because there is always a 
                                business aspect in all subjects, may it be engineering, arts or medicine. We recognise the abundance of 
                                talent in Santa Monica College and we strive to serve as a valuable resource to students and become a vital 
                                asset to the community in Santa Monica College.
